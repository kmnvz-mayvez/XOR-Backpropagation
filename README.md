# XOR Backpropagation Deep Learning

**Backpropagation** is a supervised learning algorithm used in training artificial neural networks, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. **XOR** (exclusive OR) is a classic binary classification problem that can be solved using a neural network trained with backpropagation.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Data Preparation

1. Define the XOR truth table, which has four data points: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).
2. Label the output for each data point according to the XOR operation (0 XOR 0 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 0 = 1, 1 XOR 1 = 0).

### Network Architecture

3. Create a simple feedforward neural network. In this case, a network with one hidden layer containing two neurons and one output neuron will suffice.

### Initialization

4. Initialize the weights and biases randomly for all neurons in the network.

### Forward Pass

5. For each data point, perform a forward pass through the network by computing the weighted sum of inputs and applying an activation function (typically the sigmoid function or ReLU).
6. Calculate the output of the network.

### Calculate Error

7. Compute the error (the difference between the predicted output and the actual target) for each data point.

### Backpropagation

8. Update the network's weights and biases using the backpropagation algorithm. The backpropagation algorithm involves the following steps for each data point:
   - Compute the gradient of the error with respect to the output layer's weights and biases.
   - Compute the gradient of the error with respect to the hidden layer's weights and biases.
   - Update the weights and biases in the direction that minimizes the error using a learning rate and the computed gradients.

### Repeat Steps 4-6

9. Repeat the forward pass and backpropagation steps for multiple epochs until the network converges to a solution.

### Testing

10. After training, you can test the network by providing new input data to make predictions. Ensure that the network produces the expected XOR outputs for the given inputs.

### Fine-Tuning

11. Adjust hyperparameters like the learning rate and the number of hidden neurons if necessary to improve the network's performance.

This is a simplified example, and real-world problems may require more complex architectures and training techniques. Nevertheless, the backpropagation algorithm remains a fundamental concept in training neural networks. Keep in mind that, for XOR, a simple neural network as described above should be able to learn the function effectively.
