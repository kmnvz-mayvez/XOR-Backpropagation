## Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for XOR Problem

The following figure illustrates an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed to tackle the Logical XOR problem. This ANN comprises:

- **2 input neurons** (u1, u2)
- **Bias neuron** (u0)
- **1 hidden layer** with **2 neurons** (u3, u4)
- **1 output neuron** (u5)

The activation function employed for each neuron (u3, u4, and u5) is the **sigmoid function**.

### Backpropagation Update

If the ANN is designed to solve the Logical XOR problem, you can update the weights (Wij) after **1 (ONE) EPOCH ONLY** using the backpropagation algorithm with a **learning rate h = 0.1**.

### Error Reduction

During this update, it's crucial to check if the error is reduced, as the objective of the backpropagation algorithm is to minimize the error and enhance the network's performance.
